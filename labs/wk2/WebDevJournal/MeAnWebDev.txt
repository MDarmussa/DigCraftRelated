After 14-weeks, I see myself having lot of experience and knowledge in web developement that can prepare me for a job in this field. 

In 6 months, I would believe I will have a job already as an entry level. 

One year from now, I will have already explored the job market and where to sattle in a certain company.

I have a mixed feeling between excited and scared to not having the right skills and experience that qualify me to get a job faster.

I am hoping to learn all the necessarily skills and growing my career in this field

I believe there are many roadblocks when it comes to achieve a goal. This can be vary depending on the situation.

To circumvent any roadblock is to not get despair and trying the best and setting a positive plans to solve any issue that face us.

I would say I might need help to share expeience and go through any issue I have when it comes to learn the subjects by one-one meeting. In the soon future, I might need help in preparing myself for career market like fixing my resume, and preparing for interviews.
