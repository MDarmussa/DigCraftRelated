               <p>This excercise is about making lists <br> Here's what I like about lidts:</p>
               <ul>
                    <li>They're useful for displaying lists or stuff</li>
                    <li>Thts's about it</li>
                    <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
               </ul>

                    <li>Decid if it's an order list or not</li>
                    <li>if it's not an ordered lis, use the ul tag, otherwise, use the ol tag</li>
                    <ul>
                         <li>use li tags nested in the lists inside each other</li>
                    </ul>
                          <ol>
                               <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                          </ol>

               </ol>
          </div>

               <li><i>If you want to sound interesting, try the italic tag</i></li>
               <li><b>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag</b></li>
